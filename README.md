This extension exists to stage the proposal from [issue 374](https://github.com/open-contracting/standard/issues/374) to add a ```contractPeriod``` property to the ```tender``` section.

The extension also adds a ```contractDuration``` field in ISO8601 duration format to the ```tender``` section and introduces a custom format attribute ```duration``` to support validation.
